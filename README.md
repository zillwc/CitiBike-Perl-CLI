# CitiBike-Perl-CLI
### Get realtime updates on citibike docks and bikes through terminal
Not enough time to bring out my phone and use the app to find the closest citibike dock with available bikes so I built this to always run on my desktop. have plans to integrate with pebble watch sooner or later. Probably later.
